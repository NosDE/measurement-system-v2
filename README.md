# Beep measurement system
This is a repo containing the drawings to create the open source hardware for the Beep measurement system.

## Instructions

The measurement system casing is designed as both an electonics/sensor housing, as well as a weighing frame. The outer casing is assembled in four pieces (2 tops, 2 bottoms) out of 18mm thick plate 'Betonplex' (glued multiplex with water resistant top and bottom layer). The wooden top and bottom are connected together by the 2 weight sensor (aluminium) blocks, held in place by 2 weight sensor brackets each. The left and right part are held together with 2 stainless steel tubes, that are screwed on the wood. At one side tightly, using wood parkers, at the other side loosely, using m4 bolts that go inside the inserts. By this connection, the total size of the frame is adjustable for different types of hives.

This is a picture of the milling software, with which we mill 42 pieces (21 tops, 21 bottoms) out of an 2440 x 1220 x 18 mm Betonplex.

## Drawings
The folder 'drawings' contains two folders: wood and stainless steel. 

### Wood
The 2D drawings in both Illustrator format and DXF (required by most milling parties).

### Stainless steel
The 3D and 2D drawings of the stainless steel tube, and the sensor bracket are in this folder. They can be ordered at companies lasering steel.

## Improvements
If you have improvements, or ideas for creating a better frame, please send an e-mail to pim@beep.nl explaining your thoughts. Or just fork this repo, and do a pull request with you adjustments, or additions.
